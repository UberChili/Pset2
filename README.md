# Pset2

My take on solving Pset2 from Harvard's CS50 course.

This problem set involves using command line arguments, implementing our own functions, as well as heavy usage of arrays and being able to play around with them.

The pset consists of three main programs:

# Initials

Simply takes a string, converts the initials of each word to upper case and prints them to screen.

# Caesar

Given a number key, applies Caesar's cipher to the user's given plaintext string, then prints the result ciphertext on screen.

# Vigenere

Similar to Caesar, takes a word key, instead of a number key, then proceeds to apply Vigenere's cipher to the user's given plaintext string, then prints the result ciphertext on screen.
